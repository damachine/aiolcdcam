# details:
#   This systemd handles the CoolerDash daemon service.
#   It is designed to run as a dedicated user for security reasons.
#   The service requires the coolercontrol-liqctld and coolercontrold services to be running.
#   It uses a configuration file located at /etc/coolerdash/config.ini.
#   The service will restart automatically if it fails.
#   It also sets up runtime directories and file permissions for proper operation.
#   The service is set to start after the network is available and the required coolercontrol services are running.
#   The service will run with the user 'coolerdash' and has a dedicated runtime directory at /run/coolerdash.
#   The service will read and write to the specified paths and has a PID file at /run/coolerdash/coolerdash.pid for process management.
#   Do not run as root. Use dedicated user for security.
#   See README.md and AUR-README.md for further details.
# example:
#   To enable and start the service, use:
#   sudo systemctl enable coolerdash.service
#   sudo systemctl start coolerdash.service
#   To check the status of the service, use:
#   systemctl status coolerdash.service
