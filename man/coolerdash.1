.SH NAME
coolerdash \- CoolerDash Temperature Monitor (Professional Modular C Daemon)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B coolerdash
.br
.B coolerdash
[\fB\-\-help\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B coolerdash
is a high-performance, modular C99-based daemon with professional systemd integration that monitors CPU and GPU temperatures and displays them graphically on the LCD display of an NZXT water cooler. The program is fully developed in modular C99 architecture for maximum efficiency, maintainability, and production stability.

The program always runs in a fixed two-box layout (CPU top, GPU bottom) and does not support display mode selection. All mode logic and coolant display have been removed for simplicity and reliability.

Note: Support for selectable display modes (e.g. load bars, circular diagrams) may be reintroduced in a future version if there is sufficient demand.

The program communicates with the device via the native CoolerControl REST API without Python dependencies and provides detailed systemd logs for professional service management.

.SH CODING STANDARDS
The source code strictly follows ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (C99) and project coding standards:
.TP
- Doxygen-style comments for all functions and modules
- Consistent naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for typedef structs)
- Robust memory management (check malloc/calloc/realloc, free memory, set pointers to NULL)
- Use of include guards, const/static/inline where appropriate
- Clean code structure: separation of declarations, definitions, and implementations
- All code comments in English
- See PKGBUILD and Makefile for build and packaging standards

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Start program (fixed two-box layout, CPU/GPU temperature only):
.B coolerdash
.TP
Show help:
.B coolerdash --help
.TP
Service management:
.B sudo systemctl start coolerdash
.br
.B sudo systemctl status coolerdash
.br
.B journalctl -u coolerdash -f

.SH SYSTEMD INTEGRATION
The program provides professional systemd integration with detailed logs:
.TP
.B Service Installation
.B sudo make install
.br
Automatically installs the service and restarts it on updates.
.TP
.B Service Management
.B sudo systemctl enable coolerdash.service
.br
.B sudo systemctl start coolerdash.service
.br
.B sudo systemctl status coolerdash.service
.TP
.B Detailed Logs
.B journalctl -u coolerdash.service --since "10 minutes ago"
.br
Shows module initialization, CoolerControl connection, and operating status.
.TP
.B Makefile Service Shortcuts
.B make start, make stop, make restart, make status, make logs

.SH PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
The streamlined design offers the following performance benefits:
.TP
.B Minimal I/O
Only temperature sensors are read for CPU and GPU (no mode-dependent logic).
.TP
.B Sensor data caching
CPU: hwmon paths are cached at startup.
GPU: 2.5-second cache with nvidia-smi.
.TP
.B Change detection
Display updates only on significant changes (0.1°C for temperatures).

.SH CONFIGURATION
All important runtime and build-time settings are managed via configuration files:
.TP
.B /etc/coolerdash/config.ini (RECOMMENDED)
Main runtime configuration file. Edit this file to change display, thresholds, colors, paths, and daemon settings without recompiling.
After editing, restart the service with:
.br
\fBsudo systemctl restart coolerdash.service\fR
.br
Values in config.ini always take precedence over those in include/config.h.
If config.ini is missing, all settings from include/config.h are used as defaults.
.TP
.B include/config.h
Build-time defaults for all configuration values. Edit before compiling to set initial values for display, thresholds, colors, and paths.

.SH DEPENDENCIES
.TP
.B CoolerControl (REQUIRED)
Must be installed and running (coolercontrold.service)
.br
Installation guide: https://gitlab.com/coolercontrol/coolercontrol/-/blob/main/README.md
.TP
.B System Libraries
Cairo (graphics), cURL (HTTP), NVIDIA-SMI (GPU data), hwmon (temperature sensors), libinih (INI parsing)

.SH INSTALLATION
Installs to /opt/coolerdash/bin/ and /opt/coolerdash/images/.
Systemd service file is installed to /etc/systemd/system/coolerdash.service.
Default config file is installed to /etc/coolerdash/config.ini.
.TP
.B PKGBUILD and AUR
Arch Linux users can build and install via PKGBUILD and AUR. See PKGBUILD for details.

.SH UNINSTALL
Removes all files from /opt/coolerdash/ and disables the service.
The config file /etc/coolerdash/config.ini is preserved unless unchanged (Arch standard).
.TP
.B PKGBUILD
Provides uninstall logic for Arch Linux packaging.

.SH USAGE
.TP
.B Start program (fixed two-box layout, CPU/GPU temperature only):

- If config.ini is missing, build-time defaults from include/config.h are used.
- No legacy mode selection, cache directories, or UID files are used.
- All code is documented with Doxygen-style comments and follows strict coding standards.
- See PKGBUILD and Makefile for build and packaging documentation.
